title: Generating Custom Metrics with Plugins
menu_order: 80
---

The following topics are discussed:

 * [Official Plugins](#official-plugins)
 * [Listening Protocol](#listening-protocol)
 * [Reporting](#reporting)
 * [Interfaces](#interfaces)

With a Scope probe plugin, you can insert custom metrics into Scope and have them display in the user interface together with the Scope's standard set of metrics.

## <a id="official-plugins"></a>Official Plugins

You can find all the official plugins at [Weaveworks Plugins](https://github.com/weaveworks-plugins).

* [IOWait](https://github.com/weaveworks-plugins/scope-iowait): a Go plugin using [iostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iostat) to provide host-level CPU IO wait or idle metrics.

* [HTTP Statistics](https://github.com/weaveworks-plugins/scope-http-statistics): A Python plugin using [bcc](http://iovisor.github.io/bcc/) to track multiple metrics about HTTP per process, without any application-level instrumentation requirements and negligible performance toll. This plugin is a work in progress, as of now it implements two metrics (for more information read the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/weaveworks-plugins/scope-http-statistics)):
	* Number of HTTP requests per seconds.
	* Number of HTTP responses code per second (per code).

> **Note:** This plugin needs a [recent kernel version with ebpf support](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#kernel-configuration). It will not compile on current [dlite](https://github.com/nlf/dlite) and boot2docker hosts.

* [Traffic Control](https://github.com/weaveworks-plugins/scope-traffic-control): This plugin allows the user to modify latency and packet loss for a specific container via buttons in the UI's container detailed view.

* [Volume Count](https://github.com/weaveworks-plugins/scope-volume-count): This plugin is a Python application that asks docker for the the number of mounted volumes for each container, providing container-level count.

If the running plugin was picked up by Scope, you will see it in the list of `PLUGINS` in the bottom right of the UI.

## <a id="listening-protocol"></a>Listening Protocol

All plugins must listen for HTTP connections on a Unix socket in the `/var/run/scope/plugins` directory. The Scope probe recursively scans that directory every 5 seconds, to look for any sockets being added (or removed). It is also valid to put the plugin Unix socket into a sub-directory, in case you want to apply some permissions, or store any other information with the socket.

When a new plugin is detected, the scope probe begins requesting reports from it via `GET /report`.

All plugin endpoints are expected to respond within 500ms, and respond in the JSON format.

### <a id="reporting"></a>Reporting

When the Scope probe discovers a new plugin Unix socket, it begins to periodically make a `GET` request to the `/report` endpoint. The report data structure returned from this will be merged into the probe's report and sent to the app. An example of the report structure can be viewed at the `/api/report` endpoint of any Scope app.

In addition to any data about the topology nodes, the report returned from the plugin must include some metadata about the plugin itself.

For example:

```json
{
  "Processes": {},
  "Plugins": [
    {
      "id":          "iowait",
      "label":       "IOWait",
      "description": "Adds a graph of CPU IO Wait to hosts",
      "interfaces":  ["reporter"],
      "api_version": "1",
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** The `Plugins` section includes exactly one plugin description. The plugin description fields are: `interfaces` including `reporter`.

The fields are:

* `id` is used to check for duplicate plugins. It is required.
* `label` is a human readable plugin label displayed in the UI. It is required.
* `description` is displayed in the UI
* `interfaces` is a list of interfaces which this plugin supports. It is required, and must equal `["reporter"]`.
* `api_version` is used to ensure both the plugin and the scope probe can speak to each other. It is required, and must match the probe.

### <a id="interfaces"></a>Interfaces

Currently the only interface a plugin can fulfill is `reporter`.
